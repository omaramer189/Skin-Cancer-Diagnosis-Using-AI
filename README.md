# Skin Cancer Diagnosis Using AI

A cloud-based AI system that detects skin cancer from uploaded images. The system includes a mobile application for users to submit images and view results.

## Features

- Users can upload skin lesion images from their phones
- AI model predicts the likelihood of skin cancer
- Deployed on the cloud for real-time access
- Simple, clean mobile UI for fast usage

## Tech Stack

- **AI Model:** Python (TensorFlow)
- **Mobile App:** Flutter
- **Cloud Hosting:** AWS (SageMaker)
- **Version Control:** GitLab

## My Role

- Built and trained the AI model using labeled image datasets
- Deployed the model to AWS for scalable access
- Developed the mobile app interface using Flutter
- Connected app to the cloud model using REST API calls
- Tested accuracy and adjusted model hyperparameters

## How to Run

### AI Model (fROM CNN)
1. Train model on image dataset
2. Save model as `.h5` 
3. Deploy to AWS (SageMaker)

### Mobile App (Flutter)
1. Open in Android Studio
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Deploy to emulator 

## Future Improvements

- Add user login and history
- Improve model accuracy using more image data
- Add loading indicator during prediction
- Expand model to classify other skin conditions
